# React Gallery App

This is my unit-7 project for the full stack techdegree. This project focused on building a React app that would fetch data from the Flickr API. The app needed to pull in default images on page load. It gave 3 links to pre-set searches as well as a search component for additional searches. The search title/content is reflected in the URL bar and in a dynamic heading above the images. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Resource List

I relied on a few resources for help in finishing this project. Those include:
- Article on 'With Router' hook giving me access to the match and history properties of the browser. Utilized this in making the search heading dynamic. Link: https://hackernoon.com/withrouter-advanced-features-of-react-router-for-single-page-apps-42b2a1a0d315
- Data Fetching in React course from Treehouse by Guil Hernandez. Link: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/data-fetching-in-react
